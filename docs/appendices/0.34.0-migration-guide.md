# 0.34.0 Migration Guide

## Removals

- The `disable-chown` property of the `scheduler-docker-local` plugin has been removed. Mounted paths will no longer have file permissions changed during the pre-deploy phase. Files baked into the container image for herokuish builds will always be owned by the correct user.
- The `git:unlock` command has been removed. It was previously used to "unlock" a temporary directory that already existed. The directory the `git:unlock` command used to cleanup is now properly removed on exit of the `git:from-image` command.
- The k3s plugin no longer supports port mappings other than `https:443` and `http:80`. If no matching port map is specified, Dokku will use expose the app on the first port mapping, with priority given to `https` mappings over `http`.
- Golang functions to invoke plugin triggers named `PlugnTrigger*` have been removed in favor of `CallPlugnTrigger`.

## Changes

- The k3s scheduler now creates an Ingress object per domain instead of one per port mapping. This will cause a short amount of downtime during the next app deploy after upgrading to 0.34.0
- App lock files have been removed from the `/home/dokku` directory and moved into the `data/apps` directory.
- Logs are now rotated via `copytruncate` instead of `create` in logrotate.
- The k3s scheduler now defaults to nginx as it's default proxy implementation. The traefik proxy implementation is still available, though users will need to set the global `ingress-class` k3s property to `traefik` via the following command:

    ```shell
    dokku scheduler-k3s:set --global ingress-class traefik
    ```

- The path on disk to both the global `ENV` file and the `ENV` file for a given app has been moved. Users should reference environment variables via the provided plugin triggers rather than directly sourcing the ENV files. Existing ENV files are left untouched and will be removed on the subsequent Dokku install.
